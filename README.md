# DISNEY WORLD RESERVATION ASSISTANT
The DISNEY WORLD RESERVATION ASSISTANT is an automated selenium powered bot that takes user input at the command line, queries as many date/park/ticket combos as inputted and returns their live availability status to the terminal.

It can currently handle all three ticket types (Theme Park Tickets, Resort Hotel Tickets, and Passholders) and can search 2 years into the future for all four parks. It can handle as many date/park/ticket combos as the user wants and returns them on a static command line display. 

# CURRENTLY WORKING ON
- Searching thru a date range rather than an individual day.
- File I/O date packages. (will ask if you would like to search for the most recently searched set of dates/parks/tickets.)
- Termination window (stop searching after x number of hours).

# Future Plans
- Notification System (most likely will be handled thru an email account set up for the bot). 
- A GUI.
